## Project info
- Online grocery shopping is inaccessible for 285M+ visually impaired people globally 
- Current solutions like screen readers are slow, inefficient, and fail at dynamic tasks:

- Visual Dependency on other person.
     Complex checkout processes (CAPTCHAs, unlabeled buttons).
     
- Most product images have no descriptions. Example: A screen reader just says 
    "image123.jpg" instead of "fresh red tomatoes on sale.
    
- Dropdown menus read as 'List, 50 items...' forcing linear listening.
Too Many Clicks! 
     "Simple tasks like "Add 3 bananas to cart" require perfect button clicksâ€”hard without seeing.
Result: Dependence on others or abandoned purchases.


**our soultion**
- VORDER is an online grocery shopping website specially for visually impaired peoples
